### US-003A: Wire RIS Lab into sim_jobs and sim_server for non-blocking UI runs
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003

Description:
As a user, I want the Simulator UI to run RIS Lab jobs in the background using the existing job system.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add a ris_lab job type to the existing job runner (sim_jobs) with progress updates to progress.json
- [ ] Expose an API endpoint in sim_server to start RIS Lab jobs and query status
- [ ] Example: UI can start a RIS job and receive progress/log updates without blocking
- [ ] Negative case: job failure surfaces an error message and preserves partial artifacts in outputs/<run_id>/
