### US-001: Add ris_core math primitives and unit tests
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want deterministic RIS geometry, phase synthesis, and quantization functions so validation runs are reproducible.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add a ris_core module under app/ris/ with geometry (element centers + local frame), phase synthesis (uniform, steering, focusing, custom), and quantization utilities
- [ ] Example: for a known 2x2 RIS with dx=dy, geometry returns four element centers with expected spacing and stable ordering
- [ ] Negative case: invalid quantization bits (e.g., 3) raises a clear validation error
- [ ] Add unit tests covering geometry, frame construction, and quantization edge cases
- [ ] python -m pytest passes
