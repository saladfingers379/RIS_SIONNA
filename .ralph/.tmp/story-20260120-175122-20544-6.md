### US-005: Add validation harness for CSV reference data
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-004

Description:
As a user, I want to validate pattern mode outputs against MATLAB CSV exports with PASS/FAIL metrics.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Validation loads CSV with theta_deg + (pattern_db or pattern_linear) columns
- [ ] Validation run creates overlay plot (reference vs sim) and error report containing RMSE and peak angle error
- [ ] Negative case: CSV missing theta_deg or pattern column fails with a clear field list
- [ ] PASS/FAIL result is written to metrics.json (or pass_fail.json) with threshold values used
