### US-009: Add regression test fixture and validation tests
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-005

Description:
As a developer, I want a small golden fixture to keep validation metrics stable in CI.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add a small reference fixture (CSV) and a test that runs validation with known thresholds
- [ ] Validation test asserts PASS and expected metric ranges
- [ ] Negative case: intentionally perturbed data fails thresholds and reports FAIL
- [ ] python -m pytest passes
