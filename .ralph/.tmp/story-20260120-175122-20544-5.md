### US-004: Implement pattern mode artifacts and metrics
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001, US-002, US-003

Description:
As a user, I want pattern mode to compute normalized patterns and save required artifacts and metrics.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Pattern mode produces phase map, pattern arrays, and plots (Cartesian + polar) under outputs/<run_id>/
- [ ] Artifacts include raw arrays (phase_map.npy, pattern_linear.npy, pattern_db.npy, theta_deg.npy or csv) and images
- [ ] metrics.json includes peak angle, peak value, and a simple sidelobe metric (documented definition)
- [ ] Negative case: mismatched theta array lengths are rejected with a clear error
