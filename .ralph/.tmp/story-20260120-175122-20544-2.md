### US-002: Define RIS Lab config schema and snapshot outputs
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a user, I want a YAML config for RIS Lab that resolves into canonical YAML+JSON snapshots in each run output.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add a RIS Lab config schema with defaults for geometry, control synthesis, quantization, pattern/link modes, and validation thresholds
- [ ] Example: a minimal YAML config runs with defaults and writes outputs/<run_id>/config.yaml and outputs/<run_id>/config.json
- [ ] Negative case: missing required fields (e.g., N/M or dx/dy) produces a clear error listing required fields
- [ ] Config resolution is deterministic and recorded in run metadata (metrics.json or summary.json)
